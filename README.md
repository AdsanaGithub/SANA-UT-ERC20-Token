# The applications and functionalities of the (SANA-UT) Utility Token ecosystem are described below .

Clients will be able to purchase a SANA-UT utility token online line or through our App in advance of needing treatment. They can purchase the SANA-UT utility token with fiat cash, credit card, Bitcoin or Ethereum. The SANA-UT utility token can be purchased in advance similar to a pre-paid credit card or gift card. The core of our concept relies on the use of smart-contracts on the Ethereum and Holochain blockchain to provide every SANA-UT token holder an open, immutable and efficient system in order to secure and protect health care data and process payments. 

# In-clinic treatment payment:
The SANA-UT utility token allows patients or dog owners to pre-pay or make payments for their treatment through our App from their internet or enabled smart device. Owners of SANA-UT utility token when using them for payment of the treatment will received a 20% discount on the treatment cost which is expected to be $4,000 for the full treatment. A 20% discount would be $3,200 for the full treatment.

# Payment Assurance Program:
Through our Adsana App, a patient or dog owner will be able to pre pay for the treatment as a method payment assurance. Once a payment for services is made with a SANA-UT utility token, it will be held securely within our decentralized blockchain/holochain platform.

And once an appointment is made, the clinic will be able to verify the treatment has been paid in full. Both the clinic and the owner of the SANA-UT utility token have Payment Assurance the treatment will be performed and the payment will be made.

Adsana’s Payment Assurance Program takes aim at two of the toughest issues confronting the healthcare industry. The first is the lack of real-time transparency into health claims transactions involving providers and payers; then there is the amount of time it takes for providers to get paid for their service.

An inherent characteristic of a blockchain is the immutability of transaction records. Startups here use digital ledger software to verify the authenticity of data, as well as assets or documents, and use blockchain identifiers to represent and/or authenticate tangible assets.

# Partnership Business Opportunities:
This is one of our main segment of expansion. We want to establish Adsana on the B2B payment market over the next several quarters. We will develop develop relationships with business in the pet industry so that gift cards to be used in store and online can be purchase with our SANA-UT utility token. This will also include being able with SANA-UT utility token to purchase airfare, lodging and car rentals for those needing to travel to a clinic.

# Using Blockchain for Scientific Research:
According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, there are currently about 80 different DNA tests available for mutations that are associated with inherited disease in the domestic dog, and as the tools available with which to dissect the canine genome become increasingly sophisticated, this number can be expected to rise dramatically over the next few years.

In December 2004, the $30 million project funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in the United States to sequence the entire dog genome was completed and the results made publicly available. The NHGRI made the decision to fund such an expensive undertaking because it recognized the dog as an unrivalled model organism with which to study the genetics of a wide range of inherited traits, including inherited disease, behavior, and morphology. Although the NHGRI’s motives for sequencing all the DNA in the dog were primarily human-centric, the findings that have emerged from the canine genome project, and that will continue to materialize for many years to come, have profound implications for both veterinary and human medical research.

With unrelenting media pressure focused firmly on the health of the purebred domestic dog, veterinarians and dog breeders are turning increasingly to DNA tests to ensure the health of their dogs. It is ultimately the responsibility of the scientists who identify disease-associated genetic variants to make sensible choices about which discoveries are appropriate to develop into commercially available DNA test.

Many ailments and conditions stem from genetics passed down in the bloodlines of breeds and some sets of DNA complicate a dog’s reaction to medications.

DNA testing for dogs falls into two, potentially related categories – breed identification and identifying potential disease-causing mutations. Identifying a dog’s breed make-up with a DNA test may point to an increased likelihood of
particular conditions developing in the future but is certainly not definitive. On the other hand, tests for specific genetic mutations, some of which are now being included in over the counter dog DNA test kits, are more predictive.

As part of Adsana’s continued clinical research, Adsana will, with the permission of the owners, collection the DNA of the dogs Adsana treats. And will offer DNA test for any dog even if not being treated for cancer. This data collected will be stored within Adsana’s decentralized platform of blockchain and holochain and this data collected will have far reaching results in treating, tracking and diagnosing of diseases in dogs, especially cancer.

# Earning SANA-UT tokens:
Clients of Adsana will be able to earn SANA-UT utility tokens by spreading the word on social media, referring others, and participating in an video exit interview concerning their experience at an Adsana’s Canine Cancer Center.

# Airdrops & Bounties 
Airdrops, bounty campaigns, and gamified launch events are designed to motivate people and spread the news. These initiatives can help to garner a critical mass of people curious about the project, raise awareness for the token launch as well as gain early adopters and users of the ecosystem. 

# After the complete of both the Pre-sale and the Main SANA security token sale (STO) sale, Adsana will issue the utility token.
